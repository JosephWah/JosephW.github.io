## Overview

<span style="font-size: 18px">•	Recognized as Division Finalist at the 2018 VEX World Championship.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 18px">•	Designed, built, and programmed competitive robots from the ground up to meet event-specific design challenges.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 18px">•	Used CAD modeling tools to iterate on robot subsystems and mechanisms.</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px">•	Collaborated with team members to improve overall efficiency and modularity.</span>  
<span style="font-size: 18px">•	Mentored younger team participants in design principles, gear ratios, motor control, and autonomous logic.</span>
