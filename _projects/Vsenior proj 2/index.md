## There are three loading conditions applied to the plate, as illustrated below:
<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 18px">Uniform bi-axial loading:</span>

<br><br><br>
<span style="font-size: 18px">Uniform bi-axial loading plus a constant force applied through the plate's thickness:</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px">Non-uniform bi-axial loading:</span>
