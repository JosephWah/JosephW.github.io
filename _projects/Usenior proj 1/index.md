## Several initial concepts were developed first and Pugh Matrices were used to select the best one (higher is better):

## For the H-Type vertical-axis turbine, the NASA LRN 1015 airfoil was used not because it had the highest peak efficiency, but because it's operating range was the largest given the average wind speed in Bowling Green:

## For the heat generation subsystem, the basic metal tube with magnets rotating within was chosen and the final design is as follows:
